# Generate Tokens

> By [@arav06](https://github.com/arav06)

These are simple smart contracts to generate an ERC20 Fungible Token and an ERC721 Non-Fungible Token using the smart contracts of OpenZeppelin

You can run these in the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org)

Make sure you set the `Name` and `Symbol` before deploying
